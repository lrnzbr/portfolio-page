So I thought about creating apps that helps young musicians practice and perform by harnessing the power of machine learning. I started out by creating an app in python that can be trained upon multiple versions of a specific song. Feeding snippets of a song as frequency fingerprints into anÂ ML algorithm, my hope is to create an app that can predict where a musician is in a song and play along with them. Then I started creating a basic tuner App in iOS. My aim is to bring these two projects together to create a tuner and tutor to train musicians to comfortably use the full range of their instruments and get the full band experience even while practicing alone."/>
